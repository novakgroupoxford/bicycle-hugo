      <description>&lt;p&gt;Helfrid Hochegger works on cell cycle control using chemical genetic, advanced microscopy and proteomic approaches. He was trained in the Nobel Prize winning lab of Tim Hunt and has spent his career investigating the function of kinases and phosphatases in the regulation of cell cycle transitions. He distinguished himself by establishing a chemical genetics system to target mitotic and interphase Cdk activity in a vertebrate cell line. This work led to a prestigious Wellcome Trust career development award to set up a laboratory at the Genome Damage and Stability Centre at the University of Sussex. His genetic analysis of cell cycle control in DT40 and mammalian cells led to a recent senior CRUK research fellowship. His cellular model systems are specifically designed to analyse Cdk1 activity thresholds at the G2/M transition, which will be extremely useful for the quantitative analysis of mitotic entry models. Furthermore he will contribute valuable expertise in live-cell imaging and in genetic manipulation of the mammalian cell cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
