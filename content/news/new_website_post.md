This week we launched our new website http://cellcycle.org.uk/. The site has been moved onto a more stable platform and the design adapted to fit in with the project team requirements. The publications section has been upgraded to display additional links, membersâ€™ pages now show their project publications and PPSIM Visualisation-Dashboard more easily accessible. The work was carried out by Lukas Hutter with support from Charlotte Smith.
