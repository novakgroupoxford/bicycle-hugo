Our 2017 summer meeting was held on the 31st May at the University of Oxford in the Department of Biochemistry, with a full day of talks and enthusiastic discussions from all the groups. Presentations were given by the Investigators, Post-Docs and Students and we were fortunate to have two members of the Scientific Advisory Board with us for the day, John Tyson (Virginia Polytechnic Institute, Blacksburg, USA) and Dr Valeriu Damian, Director of the Modelling and Translational Biology, GlaxoSmithKline.
