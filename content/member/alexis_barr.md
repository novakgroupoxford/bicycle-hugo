Alexis Barr studied Biological Natural Sciences at the University of Cambridge, specialising in Biochemistry in her third and fourth years.  She carried out her PhD in centrosome biology at the CRUK Cambridge Research Institute under the supervision of Fanni Gergely.  During that time she used genetic engineering, molecular biology and live cell imaging to study centrosome function and microtubule dynamics during mitotic spindle assembly in vertebrate cells. In 2010, Alexis moved to the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), London, to join Chris Bakal's team for her Postdoctoral research, in order to take a systems-level approach to analyse the control of the G1/S transition.  She is developing tools and cell lines to analyse the signalling events around the G1/S transition in real-time, at the single cell level.  She is working closely with Stefan Heldt in Bela Novak's team towards building a comprehensive model of the G1/S transition in human cells.
