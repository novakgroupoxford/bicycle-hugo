I am a fourth-year DPhil student, modelling the G2/M transition with Helfrid Hochegger's group. We are investigating the factors that contribute to the triggering and to the hysteresis of this transtion.

My research interests also include the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, modelling the regulation of separase and its effects on the localisation of the chromosomal passenger complex.
