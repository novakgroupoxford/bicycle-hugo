Stefan Heldt studied **Biosystems Engineering** at the Otto von Guericke University in Magdeburg, Germany. He received his degree in 2009 after completing a diploma thesis on stochastic simulations of mRNA translation in the group of Prof. Celso Grebogi at the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. He then joined the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex Technical Systems for a Ph.D. developing mechanistic, multi-scale models of influenza virus infection. This work awarded him the 2016 MTZ Award for Medical Systems Biology. Since 2015, he is a postdoctoral research fellow in Bela Novak’s lab, where he uses mathematical modelling to understand the dynamic characteristics of the mammalian cell cycle and its regulation. In this project, he is working closely with Alexis Barr from Chris Bakal’s lab.
