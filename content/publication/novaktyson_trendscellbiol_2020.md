abstract = """The driving passion of molecular cell biologists is to understand the molecular mechanisms that
control important aspects of cell physiology, but this ambition is often limited by the wealth of
molecular details currently known about these mechanisms. Their complexity overwhelms our
intuitive notions of how molecular regulatory networks might respond under normal and stressful
conditions. To make progress we need a new paradigm for connecting molecular biology to cell
physiology. We suggest an approach that uses precise mathematical methods to associate the
qualitative features of dynamical systems, as conveyed by 'bifurcation diagrams', with 'signal-
response' curves measured by cell biologists."""
