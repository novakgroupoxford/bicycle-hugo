abstract = """As cells pass through each replication-division cycle, they must be able to postpone further
progression if they detect any threats to genome integrity, such as DNA damage or misaligned
chromosomes. Once a &#39;decision&#39; is made to proceed, the cell unequivocally enters into a
qualitatively different biochemical state, which makes the transitions from one cell cycle phase
to the next switch-like and irreversible. Each transition is governed by a unique signalling
network; nonetheless, they share a common characteristic of bistable behaviour, a hallmark of
molecular memory devices. Comparing the cell cycle signalling mechanisms acting at the
restriction point, G1/S, G2/M and meta-to-anaphase transitions, we deduce a generic network
motif of coupled positive and negative feedback loops underlying each transition."""
