abstract = """Two mitotic cyclin types, cyclin A and B, exist in higher eukaryotes, but their specialised
functions in mitosis are incompletely understood. Using degron tags for rapid inducible protein
removal, we analyse how acute depletion of these proteins affects mitosis. Loss of cyclin A in
G2-phase prevents mitotic entry. Cells lacking cyclin B can enter mitosis and phosphorylate
most mitotic proteins, because of parallel PP2A:B55 phosphatase inactivation by Greatwall
kinase. The final barrier to mitotic establishment corresponds to nuclear envelope breakdown,
which requires a decisive shift in the balance of cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 and PP2A:B55
activity. Beyond this point, cyclin B/Cdk1 is essential for phosphorylation of a distinct subset of
mitotic Cdk1 substrates that are essential to complete cell division. Our results identify how
cyclin A, cyclin B and Greatwall kinase coordinate mitotic progression by increasing levels of
Cdk1-dependent substrate phosphorylation."""
