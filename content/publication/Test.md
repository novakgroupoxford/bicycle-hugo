abstract = """To maintain genome stability, cells need to replicate their DNA before dividing. Upon completion of bulk DNA 
              synthesis, the mitotic kinases CDK1 and PLK1 become active and drive entry into mitosis. Here, we have tested 
              the hypothesis that DNA replication determines the timing of mitotic kinase activation. Using an optimized 
              double-degron system, together with kinase inhibitors to enforce tight inhibition of key proteins, we find that 
              human cells unable to initiate DNA replication prematurely enter mitosis. Preventing DNA replication licensing 
              and/or firing causes prompt activation of CDK1 and PLK1 in S phase. In the presence of DNA replication, inhibition 
              of CHK1 and p38 leads to premature activation of mitotic kinases, which induces severe replication stress. 
              Our results demonstrate that, rather than merely a cell cycle output, DNA replication is an integral signaling 
              component that restricts activation of mitotic kinases. DNA replication thus functions as a brake that determines 
              cell cycle duration."""
