abstract = """Human cells that suffer mild DNA damage can enter a reversible state of growth arrest known as quiescence. This 
decision to temporarily exit the cell cycle is essential to prevent the propagation of mutations and most cancer cells harbour 
defects in the underlying control system. Here we present a mechanistic mathematical model to study the proliferation-quiescence 
decision in non-transformed human cells. We show that two bistable switches, the restriction point (RP) and the G1/S transition, 
mediate this decision by integrating DNA damage and mitogen signals. In particular, our data suggests that the cyclin-dependent 
kinase inhibitor p21 (Cip1/Waf1), which is expressed in response to DNA damage, promotes quiescence by blocking positive feedback 
loops that facilitate G1 progression downstream of serum stimulation. Intriguingly, cells exploit bistability in the RP to convert 
graded p21 and mitogen signals into an all-or-nothing cell cycle response. The same mechanism creates a window of opportunity 
where G1 cells that have passed the RP can revert to quiescence if exposed to DNA damage. We present experimental evidence that 
cells gradually lose this ability to revert to quiescence as they progress through G1 and that the onset of rapid p21 degradation 
at the G1/S transition prevents this response altogether, insulating S-phase from mild, endogenous DNA damage. Thus, two bistable 
switches conspire in the early cell cycle to provide both sensitivity and robustness to external stimuli."""
